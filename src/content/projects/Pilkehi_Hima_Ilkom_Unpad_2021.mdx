## Project Offer
In my senior high school days, I was offered to make a website for the Election of Students Association Chairman of 
Hima Ilkom Unpad by one of my ex-seniors. Since it was my first chance to do something I like to do and get paid to 
do it, I was very thrilled. Of course, I accepted it. 


## First Project
To make the website, we initially offered other people from our club, FCC(Five Cyber Community), to join in and help 
us do it. But in the end..., well it was only the two of us (my good friend Belati Jagad). Both of us have learned the 
web independently for our hobbies, so making something that will be used was a new challenge.


## Conclusion
In the end, this was the web that resulted from this project. I was able to make it public since we didn't have any 
contract, and it wasn't going to get used again anyway. Plus, if I am honest, now(December 2024) that I looked at it 
again, it was kinda bad.
