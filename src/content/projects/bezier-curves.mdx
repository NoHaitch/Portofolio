Building Bézier Curves with Brute Force & Divide and Conquer based Midpoint Algorithm

## Bézier Curves

Bezier Curves is a technique used to make a curve from a list of points. 
It is commonly used by most drawing application due to its easy to manipulate curves.

## Algorithm

To make the bezier curves we used brute force & divide and conquer. 
This is so we can see the difference in speed between using brute force and using DnC.
