Wikirace Solver web application, using the combination of BFS and IDS to solve Wikirace

## Wikirace 

Wikirace is a game of finding the fastest way to get from a source Wikipedia page to a target page, 
where the number of links needed matters to the amount of time to reach the target page.

To solve this problem we used both BFS and IDS to find the unkown solution. Turns out this process 
takes a very long time. Assuming that in each page there is around 50 links to another article. On 
the fourth level of depth there will be 50^4 or 6 milion links to check. Since we were scraping and 
not using wikipedia API, this become super hard to do fast. 

We scrape since it was one of the condition given by the assistant. Don't do illegal scraping please!
