My experience as a staff in the Material, Methods, and Event Division of PAB UBV 2023.

# UBV ITB - Unit Bola Voli ITB (ITB Volleyball Club)
UBV ITB or ITB Volleyball Club is a club where the members are connected by the sport of volleyball. 
It's where all the people who like playing volleyball go to. It may seem just a simple club from the 
outside perspective, but actually, it's very hard to get into the club. To be part of the club you must 
go through a member selection called PAB UBV, which will be explained in the later part.

## Open Recruitment and Jatifest
Just like any other club, UBV also first opens an open recruitment that any student who is studying in 
ITB can sign up for. ITB also holds an event where all the clubs have a chance to show their clubs and 
recruit new members.

# Member Selection - Main Event
UBV ITB is strict on who can become its member. Even though it's just a volleyball club, we highly hold 
family, organization, and volleyball, which are our core values. Becoming part of UBV takes a long time and 
many hardships, but mainly, I think the hardest part is committing. To commit to fully do all the tasks, to 
fully endure all the problems given to you, and still strong enough to hold out till the end. That's what it
takes to be a member of UBV ITB. This event of finding only those who fit is called PAB UBV ITB or Penerimaan 
Anggota Baru UBV ITB. 

## Material, Methods, and Event Division of PAB UBV 2023
In the PAB UBV 2023, I am part of the Material, Methods, and Event Division. This division is the core of PAB UBV 
since it decides all the material and how they are given to the potensial members while also deciding the events 
of each day for until the day where the new members are official recruited.

For the small team of 8 people, we were still short-staffed since the job desc we had was so big. But still we were 
able to make PAB UBV an experience for all the new members that hold out to the end.

From 100 people who signed up, at the end of the journey, only around 30 of them made it to the end. They 
officially have become part of the UBV ITB family and I am sure each of them is proud of themself for staying 
strong and creating a big connection to UBV ITB. 


## Closing
The journey it took from being a non-member to becoming a senior member of UBV ITB was such a memorable time. 
PAB UBV took ten months of on-and-off working while we were all still busy being a student of ITB. Still, it
was an experience I won't ever forget. The friends we made, the hardship it took, and the relations we created 
are something that will last forever. 
 
**Was it perfect? No, there were so many mistakes.** 

**Do you regret participating? Absolutely not.**
