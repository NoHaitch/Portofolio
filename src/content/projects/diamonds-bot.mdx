Application of greedy algorithm in making a bot for Diamonds

## Greedy Algorithm

Greedy algorithm is an algorithm that chooses the best option in an instance without 
calculating if it is the best option to get the global optima.

There are many ways of implementing the greedy algorithm, all of which only analyze the current state to get the best move.

## Diamonds
Diamonds is a game made by a random person (idk who) which is uncompleted. 
The IRK assistent then fix the game, altough there is many bugs and problems for the program.
Diamonds takes a bot from the client to play the game of diamonds. Diamonds objective is to get the most points posible by taking diamonds on the board.
There are blue diamonds(worth 1 point) and red diamonds(worth 2 points). There are also portals, a randomizer button, as well as other bots in the game.

## Diamonds Bot
To make a diamonds bot we used the greedy algorithm, making the total of 5 versions:

- **MyBot** is our main bot which uses a modified Greedy by Path algorithm

Other bots made:
- Greedy By Points
- Chase Enemy
- Random Logic
- Stay at Base
