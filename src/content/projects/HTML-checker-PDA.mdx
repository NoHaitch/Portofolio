Using Push Down Automata to check HTML syntax in Python.

## Push Down Automata (PDA)

In learning formal language and automata, We were tasked to apply PDA concept to actualy problems. In which we were told to make a HTML checker.
We used Python to read a txt file containing the PDA definition as well as the PDA for the actual HTML checker.

## HTML Checker
Here are the elements that is checked in this program
#### 1. List of tag checked: 

html, head, body, title, link, script, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, br, hr, div, a, img, button, form, input, table, tr, td, th


#### 2. Tag with nested
html, body, head, div, form, table


#### 3. Formating element tag
em, b, abbr, strong, small


The resulted PDA diagram for the HTML checker can be found below.
