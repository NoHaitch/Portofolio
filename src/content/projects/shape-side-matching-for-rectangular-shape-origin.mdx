Shape Side Matching using string matching and similarity. 

This program uses Knuth Morris Pratt (KMP) Algorithm and Boyer Moore (BM) Algorithm for string matching. It also uses Levenshtein Distance for string similarity.

You can find the paper on this link: [Application of String Matching and String Similarity
for Shape Side Matching](https://informatika.stei.itb.ac.id/~rinaldi.munir/Stmik/2023-2024/Makalah/Makalah-IF2211-Stima-2024%20(87).pdf)
