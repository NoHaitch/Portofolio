Candi Management System CLI using primitive python (limitation: not using already made functions; most function are made from scratch). 
The code is fully documented but is still using Indonesian Langguage. 

Candi Management System is simple program that simulates a software for managing Candi like ownership, employees, and simple currency. 
The objective is to learn programming from scratch without needing to rely on built-in python functions.
