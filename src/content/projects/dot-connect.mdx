Dot-Connect is a simple game with the objective is to use connect all the usable dots given. You must connect all the dots in the board 
starting from the starting point. You can only connect the dots that are adjacent to each other (left, right, top, bottom). To win you must 
connect all the dots in the board without any dots left unconnected.

This web app is made to play the game using the browser. This project also include a backend server to handle the game logic as well as data
 storage using sql database. The backend server is made using Golang Gin and the frontend is made using React with tailwind.
