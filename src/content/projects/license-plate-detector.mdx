Detect and extract license plates from images using pre-trained Machine Learning [Tesserac OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr).

## ML/DS At GDSC ITB

In GDSC ITB (Google Developer Student Club Institut Teknologi Bandung), I participated in the Machine Learning/Data Science course. In the 
course, I learned the basics of Machine Learning with Data Science. For the course, I needed to do a final project to prove my learning. 
This project is my way of showing at the very least I learned something by participating.

## License Plate Detector

License Plate Detector is a program that takes images and extracts license plates from them. At the core, it uses image processing to extract data 
that will be input to a Machine Learning algorithm to extract the actual license plate text. Since I didn't have enough time as well as the complexity 
to make a Machine Learning model myself, I used Tesseract OCR, an open-source text recognition (OCR) Engine.
