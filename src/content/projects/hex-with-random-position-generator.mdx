Hex Game With Random Position Generator made using Python. This program is made to give a statistic to 
prove that going first in the game of Hex is more advantageous. This program can play Hex Game inside t
he CLI and also simulate a random game of HEX. 

You can find the paper made at this link: 
[Application of Graph Theory on the Advantage of Going First in Hex](https://informatika.stei.itb.ac.id/~rinaldi.munir/Matdis/2023-2024/Makalah2023/Makalah-Matdis-2023%20(91).pdf)

In the paper, I've proved that there a winner in Hex. Using analysis and theortical thinking, I've also 
shown that it is more advantageous to play the first move(start first). Using this program I've shown that 
even in using random probability of game state, We can see that the chance of winning by the player who starts first, is bigger.
