## HMIF Goes Out
On September 3rd, 2024, I had the opportunity to participate in a company visit to Lintasarta in Jakarta. It was one of the events from my Informatics Student Association, 
HMIF Goes Out, where members can participate in rare events like company visits to big tech companies, like Tiket.com and SeaBank. 

HMIF Goes Out is an event where many of the members go out on a group trip. Most of them have costs handled by the association. It may just be a simple trip to a local 
mall or even a long trip like a company visit to another region.

## Company Visit 
Company Visits are events where a group of students get a chance to visit the company workplace. In these events, the company usually gives the students an explanation 
and shares worker's experiences at the company. The students get real-life ideas, problems, and solutions while the company can have a chance to promote their ideas in 
hopes that in the future, one of the students come back to take an internship or even work at the company.

## Closing
The company visit was a wonderful, fun, and insightful experience. Before going on the trip, I have never heard of Lintasarta and its work. However, after the visit, 
I was super interested and intrigued by Lintasarta and its world. The company visit was a rare opportunity to get a new experience. It makes me even want to join the next HMIF Goes Out events!
