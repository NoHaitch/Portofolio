Mewcrosoft is an Operating System made from scratch using C langguage with help of GNU tools and QEMU.

## Operating System

In our journey to learn more about how system works, we were task to make an operating system from *"scratch*" using C. 
It was really hard to do. We had so many problems as there is little resources in the internet that can fully explain how to make an OS from scratch. 
I mean, who in the right mind think that making my own OS in 3 months(while attending other big courses). 
Although I learned that making an OS is really hard especially if the error/cause is from the root of the project.
