Announcement - Computational Science and Engineering Laboratory Assistant
I am happy to announce my new position as a Computational Science and Engineering Laboratory Assistant. It wasn't easy, and I endured many hardships.

## IRK (Ilmu dan Rekayasa Komputer) 
IRK (Ilmu dan Rekayasa Komputer), Computational Science and Engineering Laboratory is a lab that handles many Informatic courses.
The courses that are handled are:
- Discrete Mathematics
- Geometric and Linear Algebra
- Formal Language Theory and Automata
- Algorithm Strategies
- Probability and Statistics

## Selection Process
The selection is done in around two months. To describe the selection process, I would say that it's like a Competitive Programming 
A contest where each participant competes to get the most points. Instead of programming language problems, we use tasks with each task 
having a score component of normal points, bonus points, and a multiplier. For the first person to submit a task they will get a multiplier 
of 1.00x. For the second person, it will go down to 0.95x, for the third person is 0.90x, and for the rest, the multiplier will be 0.80x.

# Closing
In total, there were 11 tasks, and all of them had their unique problems and solutions using all the knowledge we gained from IRK courses. 
It was very useful since all the tasks forced us to do personal research to learn many new things.
