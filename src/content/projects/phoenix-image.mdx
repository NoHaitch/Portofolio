You can find the Figma design here: [https://www.figma.com/design/MJY3VVW3GHJgpds7RC9MFg/Phoenix-Image?node-id=7618-482&t=sRB9Ku6yHMf6flbl-1](https://www.figma.com/design/MJY3VVW3GHJgpds7RC9MFg/Phoenix-Image?node-id=7618-482&t=sRB9Ku6yHMf6flbl-1).

Phoenix image is a Content-Based Image Retrieval System (CBIR) web application using Nextjs and C++.


## Phoenix Image 

In learning Linear Algebra and Geometry, we were tasked to use the knowledge we learn in a project. 
That project was making a [Content Based Image Retrieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-based_image_retrieval) System.
It has two modes, one uses color similarities and the other uses texture similarities. The report(laporan) explain the details 
of the theory behind the CBIR although it is in Indonesian langguage.

The web uses Nextjs as the framework and we used local c++ execution to calculate the similarities of images.
We used Nextjs for fun without any reasons, and c++ for fast calculation of similarities.
