Password Game Web Application using react tailwind and golang with firebase authentication. 
Inspired by the original [password game](https://neal.fun/password-game/), but modified by adding many additional features.


Password game is a game where the user make a password that must fufill many rules as challenges. The goal is to create a password 
good enough that it fufill all rules within a short amount time. This project re-creates the password game with my own twist and other 
feature other than the game. Some of those features are: save and load game, cheat, history, and global leaderboard. From this project 
I am able to learn many things like authentication and maintaining an efficient api to be able to keep up with the frontend.
