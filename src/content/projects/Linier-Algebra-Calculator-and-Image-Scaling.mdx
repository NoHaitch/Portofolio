Linier Algebra Calculator and Image Scaling using Java CLI.

Contains programs on Systems of Linear Equations (SPL), Determinants, Polynomial Interpolation, Multi-Linear Regression, and 
Bicubic Spline Interpolation. 

## SPL Calculator

To solve SPL, we implemented many methods to solve it: 
1. Gauss Elimination Method 
2. Gauss-Jordan, 
3. Inverse Matrix
4. Cramer's Rule.

## Polynomial Interpolation

Given a list of points, find the polinom Pn(x) such that it goes trhough all of the data points. Basicly getting a 
Polynomial equation to that represents an equation that connects all of the distinct points.

## Multi-Linear Regression

Linier Regression is predicting the value using Polynomial Interpolation. We will implement the general equation for Multi-Linear Regression.

## Bicubic Spline Interpolation

Bicubic Spline Interpolation is used to predict the function from points of data, making a service that is smooth and continous. 

## Image Scaling (Quality Increase/Decrease using Bicubic Spline Interpolation)

Using the already implemented Bibucubic Spline Interpolation, we can apply it in increasing/decreasing an image quality. It improves 
the quality by adding more pixels to the image and using the pixel color resulted by the bicubic spline calculation.
