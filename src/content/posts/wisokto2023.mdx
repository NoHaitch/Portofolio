My experience as part of the Wisuda Oktober HMIF ITB 2023 was my first contribution to HMIF ITB (Informatics Student's Association at Bandung Institute of Technology).


## Wisokto (Wisuda Oktober 2023)
After recently joining the Informatics Student Association, HMIF, I was given a way to contribute by being part of the committee for Wisokto 2023. Wisokto is a celebration 
event that symbolizes the last signoff for the graduating students. Student associations participate as a celebratory gift to all members graduating and represent a sign of 
respect, honor, and thanks for all the members have done for the associations. This celebratory event peaked at the arak-arakan, where the current active members lead the 
graduating students while singing the association hyme and marching through the whole Institute.

## Staff for the MSDM(Human Resource) Division
In the Wisokto HMIF 2023 committee, I become a part of the Human Resource Division. In this division, our task is to oversee the whole committee and help if there are problems 
in management. I was the one who oversaw the Operation Division, which takes care of the stuff needed for the events. The Operation Division consists of 8 people, whom I helped 
with many problems regarding human management problems like who does which job and so on.

Another task of being a staff of MSDM is that I need to organize and maintain data for 183 other committee members. This data is collected and will be transferred to the 
association to keep track of the contribution each member has made. 

The last task of being a staff of MDSM is to score whether the staff at the division that we were in charge of is doing their job properly or not. This is so we can choose 
the best staff from each division, and in my case, I will be the one choosing the best staff for the Operation Division.


## Closing
Wisokto 2023 was one of my best experiences by being part of the Informatics Student Association, HMIF ITB. The arak-arakan was such a thrill-filled with emotions like the sense of belonging. 

If I was one of the graduation students, I would be full of sadness to say goodbye to our beloved association.

As proof of being part of Wisokto HMIF 2023, here is the participation certificate.
