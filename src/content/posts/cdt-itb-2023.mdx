My Experience being a trainer for Character Development Training Institut Teknologi Bandung (CDT ITB) 2023.


## CDT ITB
CDT, Character Development Training, is a training done by ITB for all freshmen. It's an event that must be taken by all 
the freshmen. CDT itself trains the students about the basic characteristics needed to survive the harsh environment of 
being a university student. So if you skip the event or have a bad final score, you must partake in next year's CDT.

In CDT the freshmen are called the trainees and the teachers are called trainers. Trainers are senior students who first 
must go through many selections and special training before being selected as a Trainer, including myself.

## Materials Taught
CDT taught the students about AIR ITB, which is the core characteristic ITB wants the students to have. AIR itself stands 
for Adapatif (Adapativity), Integritas(Integrity), and Rendah hati(Humility).

1. A -- Adaptability   
    Adaptability is the ability to adapt to the surrounding environment. Each student needs to be able to adapt, and each 
    student comes from all kinds of environments. Without this ability, the student will struggle in daily university life 
    which could affect academic performance.

2. I -- Integrity  
	Integrity is the quality of being honest and showing a consistent and uncompromising adherence to strong moral and ethical 
    principles and values. For example, students should hold a high value on honesty and not fall short of cheating in exams or 
    tests. This also means that students must always be ethical in the real world and not continue the bad culture like nepotism, 
    corruption, etc.

3. R -- Humility  
	Humility is the act of being modest. It's the act of knowing the bounds where one does not brag or think they are better 
    than someone else. This problem is caused by the students in ITB, mostly the best out of the best students. This usually 
    causes many of the students to brag or feel like they are better than most people out there. Thus making it a must to teach 
    the students to be modest about themself.


## Closing
It was my first time participating in an official event committee, and it was full of amazing problems and journeys. 
Overall, this is a new experience. Although I wouldn't do this again, I gained so much just by participating in this event, 
and in the end, this was a memorable experience.
