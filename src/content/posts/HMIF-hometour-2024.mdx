My experience as the winner Volleyball team for HMIF home tournament.

## HMIF Home tournament

HMIF (Himpunan Mahasiswa Informatika ITB) held a tournament event for all it's members. 
Its a tournament held for fun and enjoyment while we were in our long holidays.

There are many sports held, and I participated as the team for IF'22 Ganesha.

The IF'22 Ganesha team consists of: Me, Sutha, Ihsan, Juan, Mesach, Ben, WG, and Emery.

## Volleyball Winner

Although it was just for fun, we still had our competitiveness high trhough the roof. 
We were not going to just sit still and not be competitive. It was very fun, but in the end ... We Won!!!!

Here were the result for the Volleyball sports:
