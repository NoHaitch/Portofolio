Word Ladder Solver Using UCS, Greedy Best First Search, and A*

For Tugas Kecil 3 IF2211 Strategi Algoritma, I was tasked to make a solver for Word [Ladder Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_ladder). I made 3 algorithm of choice to solve the problem. Uniform Cost Search (UCS), Greedy Best First Search (GBFS) and A* (A star). I used Java Swing to make a simple GUI with input validation to make solver better.  

I learned a lot through this project, especially regarding pros and cons of each algorithm. I also learnt many similarities between these algorithms and their differences as well.
